# My init.lua
This configuration is a config provided by
[theprimeagen](https://github.com/ThePrimeagen/init.lua)
that I modify to suit myself

## Usage
To set this just have to run
```
./dev
```
Normallay, all should work fine. If not, try to remove the plugin folder
. All the script that I remap should be in my [dotfile](https://github.com/Ssnnee/.dotfile)
