# My init.lua
This configuration is a config provided by
[theprimeagen](https://github.com/ThePrimeagen/init.lua)
that I modify to suit myself

## Usage
To set this just have to run

```
./dev
```
Normallay, all should work fine. If not, try to remove the plugin folder
. All the script that I remap should be in my [dotfile](https://github.com/Ssnnee/.dotfile)

>! Note
Since I am using the [Optimot french layout](https://optimot.fr/) :

![Optimot layout](./Optimot-ansi.png)

I made some remap to suit my usage, so file free to look at the bottom of
remap file and delete then.
